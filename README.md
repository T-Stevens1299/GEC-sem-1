# GEC-sem-1
This repo contains the many programs I was asked to code for my Games Engine Creation module during semester 1 at Staffordshire University.
I used the github desktop client to upload my programs to this directory. Using github made it very easy to access my work on any device at any time, this allowed me to switch between the computers in the lab, to the one in my dorm and even my laptop whilst on a train!
